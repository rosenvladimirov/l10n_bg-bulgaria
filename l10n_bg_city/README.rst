*l10n_bg_city* is a module for Odoo that provides preloaded data for
cities and regions in Bulgaria. It automates and standardizes address
entry by allowing selection from a list of accurate and up-to-date city
and region names. This saves time, prevents errors, and ensures
compliance with local requirements for documents, invoices, and
reporting.

Use Cases / Context
===================

The **l10n_bg_city** module is part of the Bulgarian localization
project for Odoo. Its primary purpose is to enhance Odoo's capabilities
by integrating Bulgarian city and regional data, ensuring compliance
with local business, tax, and operational requirements.

This module provides a structured and predefined dataset of Bulgarian
cities and regions, essential for ensuring consistency and
standardization across databases used by Bulgarian users of Odoo. It
simplifies address creation, regional filtering, and reporting tasks,
focusing on accuracy and ease of use.

--------------

Key Objectives
--------------

- **Automatic City and Region Data**: Add a predefined, accurate list of
  Bulgarian cities and their corresponding regions.
- **Standardization**: Ensure addresses and locations entered into Odoo
  systems are consistent with Bulgarian standards.
- **Time-Saving**: Eliminate the manual creation and maintenance of
  city-related data in Odoo.

--------------

Use Cases
---------

Businesses Operating in Bulgaria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Automate filling in customer, partner, or company addresses by
  selecting from standardized city and region lists.
- Avoid typographical errors that can lead to inconsistencies across
  reports or legal filings.

Tax Compliance and Legal Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use the predefined city and regional data for invoices and other legal
  documents, ensuring compliance with Bulgarian regulations.

--------------

Features
--------

- Preloaded dataset of Bulgarian cities and regions.
- Association of cities with their corresponding oblasts (regions).
- Integration into Odoo's address fields (for customers, vendors, and
  companies).

--------------

Context and Need
----------------

In Bulgaria, accurate city and region information is essential for:

- Tax and financial reporting (e.g., correct address formatting on
  invoices and financial statements).
- Standardized data entry in CRM, ERP, or other Odoo modules.
- Streamlining logistics, e.g., city-based delivery routes and shipping
  documents.

Without a standardized approach, users often encounter:

- Errors in reporting or document generation due to inconsistent city
  names.
- Increased overhead in maintaining city-related data manually.
- Delays in deployment when launching new setups for Bulgarian clients.

--------------

Dependencies
------------

The **l10n_bg_city** module complements other Bulgarian localization
modules, such as:

- **l10n_bg**: For Bulgarian accounting and VAT compliance.
- **l10n_bg_config**: For automated configuration of all core Bulgarian
  localization modules.
