The **l10n_bg_city** module is part of the Bulgarian localization project for Odoo. Its primary purpose is to enhance Odoo's capabilities by integrating Bulgarian city and regional data, ensuring compliance with local business, tax, and operational requirements.

This module provides a structured and predefined dataset of Bulgarian cities and regions, essential for ensuring consistency and standardization across databases used by Bulgarian users of Odoo. It simplifies address creation, regional filtering, and reporting tasks, focusing on accuracy and ease of use.

## Context and Need
In Bulgaria, accurate city and region information is essential for:
- Tax and financial reporting (e.g., correct address formatting on invoices and financial statements).
- Standardized data entry in CRM, ERP, or other Odoo modules.
- Streamlining logistics, e.g., city-based delivery routes and shipping documents.

Without a standardized approach, users often encounter:
- Errors in reporting or document generation due to inconsistent city names.
- Increased overhead in maintaining city-related data manually.
- Delays in deployment when launching new setups for Bulgarian clients.

## Dependencies
The **l10n_bg_city** module complements other Bulgarian localization modules, such as:
- **l10n_bg**: For Bulgarian accounting and VAT compliance.
- **l10n_bg_config**: For automated configuration of all core Bulgarian localization modules.
