regulations and simplifying tax reporting and document automation.

Use Cases / Context
===================

General Information
-------------------

The **l10n_bg_tax_offices** module is part of the Odoo localization for
Bulgaria and is designed to add **regional tax offices (Territorial
Directorates of the National Revenue Agency - NRA)** as reference data
into the system. It allows businesses to associate tax operations,
documents, and company data with the specific tax authority they are
registered with. This facilitates the automation of tax reporting
processes and compliance with Bulgarian legislation.

Main Idea
---------

In Bulgaria, every company is associated with a specific territorial
directorate (TD) of the National Revenue Agency (NRA). This module helps
businesses using Odoo to register and associate tax offices in the
system to correctly reflect their tax operations.

Reason for the Module
---------------------

Bulgarian legislation requires businesses to fill out their
documentation properly, including specifying the relevant tax offices.
The absence of centralized management of these data might complicate
operations, especially for generating documents, reports, and
statements.

Purpose of the Module
---------------------

The module is designed to provide:

1. **Predefined list of tax offices**:

   - All regional tax offices of the NRA are preloaded into the system.

2. **Association with companies and tax documents**:

   - Enables businesses to specify the tax office they are registered
     with.

3. **Integration with other Bulgarian localization modules**:

   - Works with other modules like **l10n_bg** (the main module for
     Bulgarian localization) and modules for VAT declarations or other
     tax reports.

How Does It Add Value?
----------------------

- **Document Automation**: Automatically includes tax office information
  in documents such as invoices, notes, protocols, and reports.
- **Compliance with NRA Standards**: Ensures synchronization with the
  requirements of the National Revenue Agency, preventing errors when
  submitting documents.
- **Simplified Tax Entity Management**: Allows categorization and
  association of different companies or warehouses with their respective
  tax office.

Key Users
---------

This module is designed for:

- Companies registered with the NRA.
- Organizations managing documents or submitting reports to Bulgarian
  tax authorities.
- Accountants preparing and processing tax data.

Main Features
-------------

1. **Preloaded list of NRA Territorial Directorates**:

   - Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, and others (all active TDs across
     Bulgaria).

2. **Easy Integration**:

   - Can be used alongside any accounting modules in Odoo.

3. **Customization**:

   - Users can add or edit details for tax offices.

Implementation Results
----------------------

By using **l10n_bg_tax_offices**, businesses save time and resources by:

- Reducing the risk of errors when submitting reports to the NRA.
- Ensuring full transparency regarding the association with tax
  institutions.
- Increasing efficiency in document management.

Integration with Other Modules
------------------------------

- **l10n_bg**: Core module for Bulgarian localization â€“ provides a legal
  framework.
- **l10n_bg_reports_audit**: Connection with tax reports and audits.
- **account**, **invoicing**: Integration with modules for invoicing and
  accounting.
